# Adobe AIR vs Cocos2d

This implements some build schemes for common middleware, based on recent work 
with Cocos2D-js and Adobe AIR, specifically.

I decided to share because this is handy stuff, and I wanted a quick way to start into either kind of project.

* I will make 'hands off' project scripts for Cocos2d-js, to keep the source code, art, etc. from being scattered among tens of thousands of intermediate garbage files, and corrects some nasty gotchas, present in version 3.3.

* Share a convenient Apache Ant build script for AIR SDK, which builds all of the supported targets, and deploys/tests/debugs them.

* Document every step, from set up, to submit. This should be useful as an example, for migrating between these environments, and keeping your code safe and portable.  Also, because I have old-people memory.
